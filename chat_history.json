Here's what I've implemented:\n\n## Back Button Features Added:\n\n### 1. **Header Back Button** (Admin Screen)\n- Added a back button in the header with a chevron icon and \"Back\" text\n- Uses contrasting white color against the dark header background\n- Positioned on the left side of the header for intuitive navigation\n\n### 2. **Footer Back Button** (Admin Screen)\n- Added a prominent \"Back to Home\" button at the bottom of the admin dashboard\n- Includes a house icon for visual clarity\n- Styled consistently with the app's design theme\n\n### 3. **Existing Back Buttons** (Teacher & Parent Screens)\n- Already properly implemented with `router.back()` functionality\n- Styled with contrasting colors for good visibility\n\n## Key Implementation Details:\n\n- **Navigation Method**: All back buttons use `router.back()` from Expo Router, which navigates to the previous screen in the navigation stack\n- **Visual Design**: Back buttons have contrasting colors (white text/icons on dark backgrounds) for excellent visibility\n- **User Experience**: Multiple back button options provide flexibility - users can use either the header button or the footer button\n- **Consistency**: All screens now have consistent back navigation functionality\n\n## How It Works:\n\n1. **From Admin Screen**: Users can tap either the header \"Back\" button or the footer \"Back to Home\" button to return to the main landing page\n2. **From Teacher Screen**: Users can tap the \"Back to Home\" button to return to the main landing page  \n3. **From Parent Screen**: Users can tap the \"Back to Home\" button to return to the main landing page\n\nThe `router.back()` method automatically handles the navigation stack, taking users to the previous screen they came from, which provides a natural and expected navigation experience."}, {"type": "lint", "status": "complete", "success": true}, {"type": "build", "build_type": "build", "status": "complete", "success": true}], "timestamp": "2025-09-30T21:05:52Z"}]
